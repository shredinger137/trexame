          <p>Skate the Bay is a virtual skate marathon hosted by <a href="https://rrderby.org" target="_new">Resurrection Roller Derby</a>, open to skaters everywhere. This marathon started
          May 10th, 2020.
          The route comes in three types.
          <br/>
          <br />
          Mini: Equivalent to traveling across the Golden Gate Bridge and back.
          <br /><br />
          Bridging: An architectural tour of the Bay Area's most prominent bridges, equivalent to crossing the historic Golden Gate Bridge, the modern Bay Bridge, and the Richmond Bridge, which is also a bridge.
          <br /><br/>
          Full Bay: Goes around the San Francisco and San Pablo bays. 
          <br/><br/>
          There's no entry fee for participation, but we
          encourage any skaters who can to donate to their local food bank. You can visit <a href="https://www.feedingamerica.org/find-your-local-foodbank" target="_new">Feeding America </a>
          to find yours.
