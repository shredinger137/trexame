                NASA’s Fermi satellite was launched into low-Earth orbit on June 11, 2008, and continues to map the
                entire gamma-ray sky every three hours. Extremely bright emission from the plane of the Milky Way galaxy
                dominates the high-energy gamma-ray sky, formed when cosmic ray particles interact with our Galaxy’s
                dust, gas and starlight. EdEon supports the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope project by creating sky maps
                and other illustrations of scientific discoveries and by maintaining educational resources.

                <h2>Astronomy from Home</h2>
                <p>
                    A 2018 Pew research study reports that 73% of U.S&gt; adults believe the search for life and planets
                    that could support life should be important for NASA. Capitalizing on this interest, EdEon designs
                    facilitated and stand-alone online learning activities as part of the Astronomy from Home website. These
                    activities replicate scientific practices used to learn about the orbits and science of exoplanets.
                    Using images of the night sky that include known exoplanets, participants can analysis images online to
                    develop and understand light curves. Visit the website and learn more at <a href="https://afh.sonoma.edu" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer">afh.sonoma.edu</a>.

            <p>EdEon's Learning by Making (LbyM) program is an integrated 1-year high school curriculum aimed at
                providing technology and science education to rural schools. Fifty-three percent of all schools in the U.S. are considered rural and do not have access to quality Computer, Science, Technology, Engineering and
                Mathematics (CSTEM) educational offerings. Independent evaluations by WestEd have shown students in the
                LbyM program outperform their control group peers by a full letter grade in science and a half grade in
                mathematics. Learn more at <a href="https://lbym.sonoma.edu" target="_new" rel="noopener noreferrer">lbym.sonoma.edu</a>.

                <p>
                  Small Satellites for Secondary Students (or ‘S4’) fills an important missing link in NASA’s educational pipeline between Team America Rocketry Challenge (TARC) and sounding rocket flights conducted by graduate students at research institutes. Through the S4 program, students and educators gain experience soldering and assembling payloads, building rockets, recording and analyzing scientific data.
